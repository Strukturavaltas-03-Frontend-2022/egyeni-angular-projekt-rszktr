## Introduction

Welcome to my (for now) basic video game catalog app.

To catalog my video game collection I had a handy spreadsheet at hand already, so
I took the opportunity to visualize a part of it in a webapp. Hopefully it will
evolve more and more as we get along. (And maybe will prove useful to someone 
else too.)

## Start app

### From project: 
Open terminal and type: 
> ng serve -o

The page will load on 'localhost:4200'. The backend is based on Firebase so need
no command to get it started.

### From browser, online:
> https://game-collection-fb8ef.web.app/


## Used frameworks and utilities: 
Angular 14.2.10
Bootstrap 5.2.3
Font-Awesome 4.7.0
Firebase Realtime Database
